<h1>The Best Movies According to Heather</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time!</h2>

<hr/>

<h3>Clueless</h3>
<p>This movie is a classic that makes me so nostalgic
   for childhood and I will never get tired of it.
</p>

<h3>The Others</h3>
<p>This is one of my favorite horror films that has the perfect
   balance of creepy and a great plot twist.
</p>

<h3>Legally Blonde</h3>
<p>Another classic with girl power. I could watch this over and over.</p>
